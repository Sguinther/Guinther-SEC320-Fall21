1. Learning bash was very hard but very fun thankfully. I am really big into internal server work and anything that makes it easier/ is a good utility for it is right in my ballpark.
I feel like having this baseline understanding will be an exceptional way to start my career of server scripting, as I am planning on doing a lot of it in the near future. 

2. I feel like some classroom instruction on baseline concepts, even if it is just a general overview of coding concepts that are being used each week, 
would be immensely beneficial. Oftentimes so far I have been going into the assignments blind and rewatching the weekly video countless times to try and solidify concepts.
I feel like the hands-on aspect of in class learning always propels it to the front of my brain. 

3. I spent at least 6 hours on a couple of the assignments, some were longer than others though. The most I spent was 8 hours on the week 4 lab, and the least time spent was 
on the week 5 lab, which was probably around 1 - 2 hours. Getting through these assignments was brutal at times lol. 

4. Absolutely, I loved this whole section and really want to spend a good amount of time looking over these assignments again once I have ample free time to do so. I feel 
like I learn so much more about each course I've taken after the semester ends and I have time to review everything I learned.
